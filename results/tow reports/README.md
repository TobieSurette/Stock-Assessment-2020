# Snow crab survey tow data reports:

Each data report contains:

- A title containing the sampling date and the corresponding tow number as well as a tow identifier (e.g. GP354F). 
- A photo of the trawl catch.
- A map showing the sampling location.
- The vessel track during trawling, including the location of the vessel during when the trawl first touched the sea floor, when the stop signal was given and when the trawl lifted off the bottom during hauling.

Several graphs then showing various probe measurements over various trawling phases, including the descent, trawling, passive and ascent.
- The vessel speed in knots. The nominal speed during trawling is 2 knots.
- The width of the trawl wings, which is used for calculating the swept area.
- The height of the trawl headline with respect to the sea floor.
- The depth of the trawl, as measured by various probes: an acoustic eSonar depth probe, a Star Oddi probe attached to the headline, and a Star Oddi probe inside the tilt mechanism attached to the trawl footrope.
- X, Y and Z angles as measured by the tilt Star Oddi probes.
